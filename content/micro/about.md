Hi There, Thank you for visiting my blog. Myself, Raja Kesari, a mainframe/COBOL guy with 12+ years of experience of working in Cards and Payments area specialized in Authorizations. With keen interest on Emerging technolgies, I started learning Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technolgy. 

I started my journey with a certification program(mentioned below) from IIIT,Hyderabad. This has given me the neccessary introduction of decentralized ledger tech spanning many basic concepts of blockchain tech.

>Advanced Certification in Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies                                                  
                                                                                              
Then I started exploring other platforms like Corda and IBM Blockchain.

However, my heart is still with Ethereum from the day I found it. The Eco system, The EVM, the opcodes, the contracts, interfaces, libraries, ABI, web3, the calls, delegatecalls, gas... everything about ethereum excites the techincal side of me.

The intention behind this blog is to put my understanding of Ethereum blockchain and Solidity.

Please mail at <rajakesari04@gmail.com> if you have any suggestions for me. Thanks for your time.
