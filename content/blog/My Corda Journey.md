When I first came across R3 Corda, as part of my blockchain learning, the first fact that hit me hard is that it is not actually a true blockchain. Yet, it achieves what the blockchain technology truly wants to achieve especially the enterprise blockchains.

CORDA is what the current world can immediately start using and make the world ready for the true trustless blockchains like ethereum in coming future.

Coming to my intention of attempting the certification without knowing much of java or kotlin, is to learn corda at least theoretically however there was a section in the exam where I faced multiple questions based on sample code given. With some knowledge of OOPS and javascript, I could somehow able to answer those. 

I had to attempt the exam twice as I could secure 73.20% in my first attempt. The Pass score is 75%.

In my second attempt, I could get past 75% mark(75.90%).
