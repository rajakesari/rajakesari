      <description>I wanted to do an exercise from long time - To understand an already created project, by going through each line of code and see why it was written like that.
I randomly choose gnosis Multisig wallet smart contracts. This is a deprecated version and there is a latest safe version.
There are many thing that I learned while doing this however I want to share one interesting thing I learned.</description>
