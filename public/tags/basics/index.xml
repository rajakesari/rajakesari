      <description>&lt;p&gt;Before diving into EVM, let’s try to understand a bit more of What an “Account” meant in Ethereum world and how the “Transaction” effect the World State. Please go through the links, if you have not already done.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For a long time, I, who is a COBOL developer with little awareness of ‘C’, struggled to understand how the Mapping type works in Solidity. I am keeping a separate article for the same reason.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To understand the need for a smart Contract in Ethereum framework, we should revisit the Transaction where we discussed that all we can do is one kind of Transaction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Taking the same example of a Cricket match from World State, we will see why using “a ball bowled” as the transaction is right decision.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Accounts In Ethereum Context</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The concept of Blockchain it self is based on change of the state, to be precise “storing of every state change”. We can call this state-changing “action” a “transaction”. To do these transactions there has to be some entities which can be recognized by the blockchain in our case Ethereum. Let’s call these entities “Accounts”. The Ethereum blockchain recognize these “entities that are capable of doing transactions”(We just named them as Accounts) with their Address.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
