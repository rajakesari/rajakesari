<h1 class="title">Transaction</h1>

<div class="content">

    
    <p>Taking the same example of a Cricket match from World State, we will see why using “a ball bowled” as the transaction is right decision.</p>
<p>You might be thinking “of course! That is obvious” but that doesn’t give us any “way” to learn more about “transaction”. Well! I am sure some of you must be more intelligent than me but my target audience are people like me.
In this example we have given the “a ball bowled” as a transaction directly. We did not give a chance to analyze ourselves what could be the best choice for a transaction.</p>
<p>Now we have two questions?
1.	Why “a ball bowled” is an obvious choice for a transaction in a cricket match.
2.	What is such an obvious choice for a transaction in Ethereum world.</p>
<p>To understand this, let’s move away from both Cricket and blockchain. This will give us freedom to give a more generic name to this basic element which we were calling as either “a ball bowled” or a “transaction”.</p>
<p>Since this “basic element” is what driving a world,
Since this “basic element” is what changing the state of the world,
Let’s call it as “Action”.</p>
<p>If Ian just knowing about Cricket, I would think below all as actions.
Batsman hitting the ball
Catch by a fielder
Getting out
Hitting a boundary
Toss</p>
<p>But if have to choose one basic “Action”, it is “the ball bowled” that triggers all other actions.</p>
<p>Now Let’s try to understand the basic “Action” of Ethereum. For this we have to borrow help from Ethereum Yellow paper.</p>
<p>It says Bitcoin is “This system can be said to be a very specialised version of a cryptographically secure, transaction-based state machine.”</p>
<p>And “Ethereum is a project which attempts to build the generalised technology;“</p>
<p>one key goal is to facilitate transactions between consenting individuals who would otherwise have no means to trust one another.</p>
<p>From the above three lines, what I infer is the below.</p>
<ol>
<li>Ethereum is a Generalized, Cryptographically secure, transaction-based state machine.</li>
<li>It facilitates give and take between consenting individuals.</li>
</ol>
<p>And my understanding of the basic “Action” on Ethereum is a “value interchange” between two consenting entities by means of give or take.</p>
<p>Now, we can come back to the naming convention of “Transaction” as we are talking about Ethereum world and the it logically matches with the understanding	of the basic action.</p>
<p>Transaction - a “value interchange” between two consenting entities by means of give or take.</p>
<p>Now let’s see what all possible ways this transaction can take place.</p>
<p>Assume there are two entities A and B</p>
<pre><code>▪	A gives “value” to B
▪	B gives “value” to A
</code></pre>
<p>Thats it. These are the only 2 transactions in their pure form that can be done on Ethereum.</p>
<p>Well! Only 2?. Can’t we do any other kind transactions… I heard that we can do much more on Ethereum…Wait! What do you mean by “pure form”.</p>
<p>Yes..You read it right. Infact the two I mentioned above are not two but just one. They both are same kind of transactions. The basic transaction is</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>           “One entity sends “value” to another entity”
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Remember we were trying to understand the basic “Action” of Ethereum world. You just read that above.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The basic Action in Ethereum is called a “Transaction” and it means “One entity sends “value” to another entity”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is what Ethereum stores in its block. A Transaction which has the details of “which entity” sending “what Value” to “which another entity”</p>
<p>This is the state change in Ethereum world.</p>
